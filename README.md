## What it does
In times of hardship, sometimes you just need someone to talk to. anonybuddy is a web app designed to provide support to recovering addicts in a personal yet anonymous way. Users can reach out when they need help, and volunteers will chat with them over text. 

## Inspiration
When recovering addicts are struggling, the typical route is to call a hotline or attend a support group. This can be an issue for those who worry about shame, being judged, or are simply unable to make it to in-person meetups.

Existing addiction-focused apps primarily focus on self-help; self-guided therapy, behaviour tracking and automated reminders to stay on target. These are useful tools, but human connection is a powerful influence and we wanted a solution that would offer that support.

We were inspired by the app "Be My Eyes" that allows sighted volunteers to help blind or visually impaired people with vision-related tasks such as reading labels. 

With this in mind, we built a web app that would anonymously connect users ("clients"), to human volunteers ("buddies") in a one-on-one chat room. This way, they can find motivation, solace, and comfort without worry of revealing their identity.

## How we built it
anonybuddy is a React web app with a Google Firebase backend and styled components done in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. We went through a lengthy ideation and design phase at the beginning of development in order to ensure our plans were solid. As we developed, we had to downsize due to time constraints, but worked to ensure that we had a working minimum viable product by the end.

## Challenges we had
Our main challenges were in our project implementation. Our original plan was to build HTML and CSS web pages and integrate them with Firebase and React for the backend.  Running into issues led us to decide to build everything with React, which then brought up many implementation issues due to little experience with it. We also ran into some communication struggles within our team, as multiple people were working on the same thing in different ways.

## What we learned
**Communicate!** One of the most important things we'll be taking away from this project is the importance to have frequent check-ins with the team. This will prevent overlap, highlight concerns earlier, and leave more time to solve issues. Other than that, we think it's important to limit the new technologies in a hackathon. Learning a new tool is great, but it is a short time window and it's probably best to stick to one new thing and integrate it with what you already know.

Also, taking the time to make good pitch plans, slides, and Devposts is well worth it.

## What's next for anonybuddy
If we continued this project into the future, we would port it to a mobile app in order to let people connect to buddies more conveniently. We'd also love to incorporate language processing so that clients could type in their situation and get better matches. If our app were in production, we would like to ensure that mental health professionals were also on call to assist the volunteers and intervene in potentially dangerous situations.
